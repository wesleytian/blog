Hello! Welcome to my blog! Here, you can expect to find bugfixes, tutorials on new frameworks, book reviews, and miscellaneous daily musings.  

I've realized that it's better to write than not at all, so I'm going to publish shorter posts at a higher frequency. Additionally, I think this will keep people more engaged.
