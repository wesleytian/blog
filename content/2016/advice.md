title: College Advice from an Computer Science Freshman with a 4.00 GPA

### 1. Take classes with the course chair
Taking classes with the course chair for courses with multiple sections such as Linear Algebra guarantees you a proficient teacher.  They will most likely provide extra perks such as review sessions and review sheets. You are also guaranteed that the instructor will cover everything on the tests so you won't have to worry about your professor omitting something.
I took Calculus I with the course chair my freshman year. On the first day of class, he shared with the class a special link that included all the practice exams and their solutions since the creation of the course. Additionally, he told us that the link was exclusive to our class and insisted that we didn't share the login info with other sections of the course. I suppose that it may be related to keeping his position as the course chair but I that's just speculation.
Even if the course chair's section is full, you can always e-mail him or talk to him personally to grab a seat. Remember to be polite as he isn't required by any means to fulfill your request.

### 2. Always sit at the front of the class
Sitting at the front of the class makes you less afraid to shout out answers and ask questions.
You are more likely to be heard by the instructor and get your question answered. The instructor will notice you more and if you provide a continuous stream of answers and engaging questions, then you are sure to obtain a special seat in the eyes of the instructor. e.g. they will be more likely to help you out when you need help for exams or when asking about research opportunities.
You will be less likely to be distracted by your friends and what other people are doing because there is nothing in front of you so you are more likely to pay attention.

### 3. Don't pick General Education courses just for the easy A
Think about what you can learn from it, what the department's reputation at your university is, the background of the instructor teaching it and then lastly consider its difficulty.
Fulfilling your general education requirements by taking the easiest classes at your university wastes both your money (or your parents!) and your time. Don't select courses solely because you heard they are easy! However, you may benefit if you can find a course that benefits you in the long-run or just plainly interests you AND it's easy, then that's fine. Just don't prioritize the difficulty of the class over everything else. What I mean about benefiting you in the long-run are courses such as taking Game Theory (ECON 309) as a Computer Science major. Though it may seem irrelevant, it is applicable in AI, business, mathematics, psychology and other fields. Not only did Game Theory interest me, but it may actually benefit me in the long-run!
Additionally, you should do research about the instructor and department of the general education classes you want to take. At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Computer Science department is well known for its research and faculty especially in AI, but what UMass Amherst truly excels at is it's Linguistics department in the College of Humanities and Fine Arts. They are ranked 4-8 at PhDs.org - UMass in the United States and so fulfilling a general education requirement by taking a linguistics intro course is sure to be interesting and taught extremely well. Where else can you learn from the smartest professors in their field?
Take a look at PhDs.org for the departments that university excel at, it could be a well-known one or a less known one. Most undergraduates don't ever talk about the research and faculty quality of such departments, but if you talk to graduate students or professors they will know for sure.
Obviously, use your common sense as well. UMass Amherst is ranked 1-2 out of 32 programs for food science, 1-7/41 programs for Kinesiology, 3-11/83 for Polymer Science and Engineering, but if you're not interested in food science, kinesiology, or polymer science, then don't take it! Just remember to take it into consideration. You will never know what great professors you will meet and things you will learn from just fulfilling a general education requirement.
