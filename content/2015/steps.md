Sometimes you just don’t feel like going to the gym. For one reason or another, the real reason is just because you’re too lazy and don’t feel like it. Don’t make excuses. But that’s another point.

Listen up, because I’m going to teach you a way that has made everything for me easier. It should work for anything that you’ve been doing routinely, but just can’t keep it that way. Your brain works in strange ways and in order to appeal to your brain you have to take advantage of how your brain works.

If you’re feeling too lazy to do something, just divide the action into steps and start with the first step. The old adage “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a singe step” is spot-on. Sure this is common sense, but by taking a single step, you put into action a process that your brain has been doing before. Techncially, you jumpstart your brain. You trick it.

Here are some examples:
For working out, sometimes you just don’t feel like going ot the gym. You think of the walk to the gym, putting in work, sweating and putting in more effort. Effort that you don’t have the energy for right now. So begin with the first step. Put on your gym clothes. If you’ve been properly getting ready for working out for a while now, by putting on your gym clothes you will have jumpstarted your brain into getting ready to work out. Chemical reactions in your body begin to occur and you may even begin to start sweating. Each step after that will become a breeze. Lots of research has even been published about this phenomenon. An experiment was done to test the effectiveness of this. A group of people was given a placebo energy shake, one that looked to be the same as a pre-workout that they would take half an hour before going to the gym. Even though the mixture contained nothing but coloring and flavoring, they began to sweat and get “pumped”. Taking the first steps in a process gets your body prepared,

In a way, it is just like muscle memory. Not muscle memory but brain memory. You become so used to doing something that just by doing the first step, you don’t even have to think and you do everthing that follows it.

I use this method of mine for even much smaller things. Sometimes I will be lying in bed, not wanting to get up. I start with the single step of moving my leg. As soon as I move my leg, my body follows and I get up. It sounds simple, but it works like a charm.

By doing this, I won’t ever have to procrastinate anymore. No more short-term procastination at least. This method has worked for me 99% of the time. The only 1% of the time that it hasn’t worked for me is in the split-time that I make the decision to take the first step, I manage to convince myself that it isn’t worth doing. Once I was really sore from a work-out and I was lying in bed. Instead of getting out of bed to put away my clothes like I should have, I convinced myself that I needed to rest longer because of how tired I was. Besides the times when this happens, it has been successful every other time.

I use this method for everything I do now. Don’t feel like doing homework? Take out the book first. Don’t feel like writing an essay, open up an empty document and put down a single word. Don’t feel like going to school, get out of bed, and get packed. Looking at the big picture isn’t always the right approach to things. Sometimes you just have to take things step-by-step. Worry about what’s at hand and let things come to you.
