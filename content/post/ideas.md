Ideas are cheap.

Therefore, I'm going to share with you some of the project ideas that I have that I don't plan on working on. Don't worry, the reason I don't plan on working on them isn't because they are bad ideas, but because I don't have the time to work on every idea that I come up with, I may not have the skill set to work on it, or the technology they require are too far ahead of our time.
