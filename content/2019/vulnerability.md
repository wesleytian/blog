> If you don't believe in yourself, nobody else will.

During my junior year of high school, when everybody else was trying the hardest that they have ever tried, I was on the verge of being put on academic probation. I ended my first semester of junior year with a 1.96/4.00 GPA. For those that aren't familiar with the GPA scale, 1.96 is equivalent to a C+ (77-79/100). To put that into perspective, University of Michigan's entering classes' average GPA was 3.88/4.00 for 2018.

## Why was my GPA so low?

## Whose fault was it?

## Am I stupid?

## How did you get into the University of Michigan?

## How did you get a 4.00 while taking 18 credits during your first semester in college?




I ended up graduating from high school at the bottom of my class.
