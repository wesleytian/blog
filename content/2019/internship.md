These tips are the culmination of four years of applying to software engineering internships. During this time, I've interiewed with and received offers from numerous companies. As with all other tips, take them with a grain of salt. These tips were invaluable to me, but not be for everybody.

## 1. Be Flexible

## 5. It's a Numbers Game
When you're a freshman or sophomore, apply to as many internships as you can.

I submitted internship applications to nearly 200 companies during my sophomore year. Guess how many I heard back from? 15. How many offers did I get? 1.

For many sophomores in college, getting an internship isn't easy. It's easy to understand why you should be applying to as many companies as you can. Use aggregate resources such as intern.supply to streamline the process. Set a schedule for yourself. It takes a few minutes to submit an application. Spend 30 minutes a day before bed to submit applications. At a rate of two minutes per application, you'll have submitted 210 applications in just two weeks.

## 6. Embrace Failure

- This year, I was again rejected by some of my dream internships, Google, Facebook, and Apple.
Again during my senior year, I was rejected by Google, Facebook, and Apple, Tesla, and AirBnb.

## 7. Study
Study for your interviews!

What's easy about getting a software engineering job is knowing what to do. What's hard is developing the motivation to do it.
