#5 It's a Numbers Game
    When you're a freshman or sophomore, apply to as many internships as you can.

    I submitted to about 200 internship applications during my sophomore year. Guess how many I heard back from? 15. How many offers did I get? 1.

    For many sophomores, getting an internship isn't easy. It's easy to understand why you should be applying to as many companies as you can. Use aggregate resources such as intern.supply to streamline the process. Set a schedule for yourself. It takes a few minutes to submit an application. Spend 30 minutes a day before bed to submit applications. At a rate of two minutes per application, you'll have submitted 210 applications in just two weeks.

#6 Embrace Failure
    -
    - This year, I was again rejected by some of my dream internships, Google, Facebook, and Apple.
    Again during my senior year, I was rejected by Google, Facebook, and Apple, Tesla, and AirBnb.

#7 Study
    Study for your interviews!

    What's easy about getting a software engineering job is knowing what to do. What's hard is doing it.


   - interviewed for fulltime
   - recieved fte from microsoft
   - converted to internship
