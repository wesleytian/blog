But today is not the day.

You have no idea how badly I want to start a company. Maybe you do, if you know me well enough.

I've done just about everything. I've taken classes on startups, studied books such as Zero to One, worked on too many side-projects and apps, pondered potential co-founders, talked to potential co-founders, done customer research on solutions to real problems, ran large organizations, lead projects, recruited people, rejected people, sought funding, made comprehensive startup idea lists, and more.

But for some reason, my heart is telling me that now is not the time to start a company. It's true that there is a quote about successful people not needing all of the "stars" to align before going after what they want. They will just do it. But after some reflection, I just honestly don't feel like now is the time. I had the hardest time making up my mind until I read the following excerpt from an interview with Jeff Bezos.

What were your intentions when you left [graduated from] Princeton? What did you set out to do?

> I toyed with the idea of starting a company and even talked to a couple of friends about starting a company, and ultimately decided that it would be smarter to wait and learn a little bit more about business and the way the world works. You know, one of the things that it's very hard to believe when you're 22 or 23 years old is that you don't already know everything.

My only fear of not starting a company now is that I will grow complacent and settle. However, I'm going to trust in myself that if I really want to start a company one day, I will do it. It won't matter if I'm 25 or 30.

I know that I will.

So right now, I'm going to wait just a bit longer.
