I'm only writing about this because of how bizzare my recruiting process was. This post describes it. (If you'd like to know what questions my interviewers asked me, please comment below.) Not only did I apply for an internship position and receive a full-time offer but when I flew to Seattle for the on-site, the interview got cancelled so I had to fly back again. If you want tips to help you get an internship or full-time offer at Microsoft or a similar company, see [How to Get an Internship at a Big 4](/2019/internship/).

The entire process from my initial contact with a recruiter to me receiving an offer took over a year! Below is the entire timeline.

### Part 1 – First Contact

[9-14-2017] <span style="color:red"> Recruiter #1</span>: Sent me a message through LinkedIn. <br>
[9-??-2017] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Replied to Recruiter #1 through email <br>
[??-??-2017]

[11-01-2017] **On-campus 30-minute technical whiteboard interview** <br>

[11-01-2017] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Sent follow-up thank you email to recruiter and interviewer <br>
[11-03-2017] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Sent email that I was interviewing with Google <br>
[11-18-2017] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Sent email asking for updates <br>
[11-29-2017] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Sent another email asking for updates (recruiter never responded) <br>
[11-30-2017] <span style="color:red"> Recruiter #1</span>: No update according to recruiter, said intern capacity may be reached <br>
[01-09-2018] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Asked about update <br>
[01-10-2018] <span style="color:red"> Recruiter #1</span>: Still no update, recruiter said that they are recruiting for 2019 <br>

*After another month or two, I gave up on Microsoft and accepted Clinc's summer internship offer.*

### Part 1.5 – Preparation

*While interning at Clinc, I was getting ready for recruiting season by doing programming problems and mock interviews everyday after work. See tip #5 in [How to Land Your Dream Internship](/2019/internship/) for more details on how I prepared.*


### Part 2 – A Nice Surprise

[08-10-2018] <span style="color:red"> Recruiter #1</span>: Fast-forwarded to final round interview (probably due to round 1 performance) <br>
[08-12-2018] -  <br>
[08-13-2018] <span style="color:red"> Recruiter #1</span>: Confirmation of on-site interview for 8/20/2018 <br>

### Part 3 - Wait, What?

[08-16-2018] <span style="color:red"> Recruiter #1</span>: **"We’re excited to have you come to Redmond, WA for the Full-time SWE [Software Engineering]" [sic]** 

*Full-time? That's a typo, right?* <br>

I was pretty sure that I was still being interviewed for an internship role because that's what I applied for and my graduation date was more than a year in advance with a whole summer in between now and then. Even if it was for a full-time position, I had little interest in working for Microsoft at the time so I thought the free trip and interview experience would be good practice for interviewing at other companies.

[08-17-2018] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Sent email asking some questions <br>
[08-18-2018] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Fly to Seattle <br>
[08-19-2018] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: Ask recruiter for when and where my interview is and where. Tomorrow is my interview! <br>

### Part 4 – The Blunder

[08-20-2018] <span style="color:orange"> Recruiter #3</span>: Says my interview was cancelled because they weren't sure if they booked me a flight or not. <br>
[08-23-2018] <span style="color:orange"> Recruiter #3</span>: Schedule 2nd interview for 09-07-2019. This time they send me the time and location. <br>

[09-07-2018] **Interview day (4x 60-minute technical whiteboard interviews and 1x 60-minute behavorial lunch interview)** <br>

[09-07-2018] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: I send them a thank you email. <br>
[09-14-2018] <span style="color:blue">Me</span>: I ask for updates on my process. <br>

### Part 5 - Conclusion
[09-20-2018] <span style="color:green"> Recruiter #4</span>: **Calls me and tells me that Microsoft is offering me a full-time SWE position.** <br>

After some discussion with my recruiter, I converted the offer into an internship for this summer.

Though this was a pretty terrible experience by most standards, I'm still glad it happened. I got a free trip to Seattle out of it and got an internship and full-time offer from Microsoft.
