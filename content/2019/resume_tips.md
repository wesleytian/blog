## 1. Change your graduation date

Imagine it's currently fall 2019. You were recently admitted into college last fall and expect to graduate in spring 2023. A student who has enough credits to be a junior and puts down an expected graduation date of Dec. 2018 or May 2018 instead of May 2019 will give them an enormous edge in the resume screening process. This is because companies give priority to juniors since it is easier to convert them into full-time employees.

If you were planning on graduating a year early anyways, then your graduation date should definitely not be four years from your admission date. This tip is for people who aren't sure whether they will graduate early or not.

This is a way to get around the–"we only hire juniors"–statement that recruiters tell you.

This can also work for freshmen who have enough credits to be a sophomore.

**I am not saying that you should lie on your resume.** If you don't have enough credits to graduate early, do not put down an earlier graduation date, because that would be lying. If you are 100% sure that you won't be graduating early, don't pretend you are going to either. That is also lying about your intended graduation date. **Lying on your resume is a very serious offense.** Only tweak it in your favor if you're in the described situation above.
