## 1. Change your graduation date

Imagine that you're a college sophomore, but you have enough credits to graduate a year early. If you have enough credits to graduate early and you aren't sure whether you will, it can be extremely beneficial to put the earlier graduation date that would put you at a junior standing.

Imagine it is currently the fall of 2016, you entered college in the fall 2015 and expect to graduate in spring 2019. If you have enough credits to be considered a junior, putting down Dec 2018, or May 2018 instead of May 2019 will give you an enormous edge in the résumé screening process. This is because companies strongly prefer juniors to sophomores and freshman because it is easier to convert them into full-time employees.

This is a way to get around the, "we only hire juniors" statement that recruiters tell you.

This can also work for freshman who have enough credits to be a sophomore.

**I am not saying that you should lie on your résumé.** If you don't have enough credits to graduate early, do not put down an earlier graduation date. If you are 100% sure that you won't be graduating early, don't pretend you are going to either. **This is lying on your résumé and is taken very seriously.** Only tweak it in your favor if you're in the described situation above.
