## 1. Change your graduation date

Imagine that you're a college sophomore, but you have enough credits to graduate a year early. If you have enough credits to graduate early and you aren't sure whether you will, it can be beneficial to put the earlier graduation date that would put you at junior standing.

Imagine it is currently the fall of 2016, you entered college in the fall 2015 and expect to graduate in spring 2019. A student who has enough credits to be a junior and puts down Dec 2018 or May 2018 instead of May 2019 will give them an enormous edge in the resume screening process. This is because companies give special treatment to juniors because it is easier to convert them into full-time employees.

If you were planning on graduating a year early already, then you graduation date should definitely not be in four years. This tip is for people who aren't sure whether they will graduate early or not.

This is a way to get around the–"we only hire juniors"–statement that recruiters tell you.

This can also work for freshmen who have enough credits to be a sophomore.

**I am not saying that you should lie on your résumé.** If you don't have enough credits to graduate early, do not put down an earlier graduation date, because that is lying. If you are 100% sure that you won't be graduating early, don't pretend you are going to either. That is also lying about your intended graduation date. **Lying on your résumé is a very serious offense.** Only tweak it in your favor if you're in the described situation above.
