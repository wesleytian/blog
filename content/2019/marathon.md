Tips for training to run a marathon:
(Learn from my mistakes!)

I had never been injured from doing physical activities before so I didn't expect to  be injured this time around. However, I wasn't prepared for repititive strain injury. Due to a combination of the above factors and just running a lot (60-mile weeks), I was unofficially diagnosed by my phyical therapist with a tight IT band and hip impingement. These conditions caused me to limp and hurt everytime I put pressure on my right foot for about 4 weeks. Unfortunately, this injury became apparent right after my final long run of around 20-miles. Past that point, it was 3 weeks of tapering to my race day. In order to prevent futher, potentially perennial damage, I decided to pass on this marathon. Although I didn't end up running a marathon this time around, I learned a lot. Below are some of my learnings.

Sign up for a marathon.

Follow a training program.
I used the following one here.

A few weeks before the race, start training like race day during your long run.

What I Learned

The hardest part about endurance sports is preventing your body from breaking down from lomg durations of the same repetitive movements. My muscles were rarely sore from running. The hardest parts was preventing chafing in my thighs, nipples, armpits, and getting enough water, carbohydrates, and electrolytes into my body after running for long periods of time.


My biggest mistakes:

I came home one day to a brand new pair of Nike Vaporfly 4% one day. I coudln't wait to break them in slowly so I decided to do my 16-mile long run the next day in them. Bad idea. Although I completed the run, I developed pain in the back of my knee and hips, where I was completely fine before.

Lesson #1: Break in shoes before running in them.

As I got serious about long-distance running, I began to dive into the marathon world. One famous runner, Eliud Kipchoge was known for never stretching before his runs, so silly me decided to imitate him. 


Lesson #2 Warm-up


Lesson #3: Don't only run on treadmills



Lesson #4: 

It'll be a while until I have time to train for another marathon. Training for this marathon while taking 19 credits at school and then spending time with family and freinds during graduation and then working full-time wasn't easy. I couldn't eat what I wanted to eat because I was carbloading all the time and I couldn't do more challening hikes because of my long runs over the weekends. The long runs took 3-4 hours each time not including getting changed, warming up, and showering. 4 times a week, excluding my long-runs, I would have to run for 1-2 hours. It was like a part-time job.

I guess I'll have to wait until I have the time to train for another marathon.
