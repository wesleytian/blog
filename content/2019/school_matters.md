On Friday, I went back to UMass Amherst, the school where I spent my first two years of college, to visit my friends and attend their graduation ceremony. While there I learned about what some of my friends and their friends have been up to in the last two years while I was studying at UMich.

Here are some of those differences.

- Diversity

Even if you didn't look up the demographic percentages on both universitiy's websites, you could easily tell just by attending the graduation ceremony and visiting their local bars such as McMurphy's and High Horse. Not only are there much fewer Asian, Latino, and African American people, the international population is also less diverse. There are primarily Chinese international students as opposed to students studying abroad from Europe or

in the local bar - less diversity here, less asians, latinos, african americans, international
way more exclusion, but maybe not.

- Size of graduation -

- Organization of graduation -

- How students acted when graduating - so many drunk people, some guy go so drunk he got sent to the hospital. so many drunk students, yelling, almost got into fight with my girl friends,

Post about the difference between UMich and UMass

- The student poplution and town size difference.

- only two bars, maybe 5 at most in ann orbor, umich had nearly 50

- 2 clubs, similar to ann arbor, don't know how popular they are cause i haven't been

- way less graduates

First two years I didn't realize it because I was


Why was it that only after I came back did I realize the difference, and not realize the differences earlier after I moved to Mich?
