On August 6th, 2019, Douglas Qian, Newton Xie, Noriyuki Kojimano and I set out from Mountain View, CA to climb Mount Whitney, the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States.

#### Day 2: Acclimatization at Lone Pine Lake

The next day, we trekked to Lone Pine Lake for some more acclimatization. We were terrified from reading about [altitude sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness) and [high-altitude cerebral edema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_cerebral_edema) which could permanently damage your brain and lead to death. We figured that the most we could do was get to a higher altitude for a while.

The 5.2-mile loop to the lake and back took us a total of two hours and 45 minutes. We stayed at the lake for a couple of hours to help with the acclimatization. On the ascent, we heard and saw lightning from multiple directions so we were afraid that would jeopardize our summit day plans. besides the effects of altitude sickness, the most dangerous thing that could happen in this area was being struck by lightning. As Janet Rae-Dupree and Edward J. Boyer of the Los Angeles Times write,

<blockquote>LONE PINE, Calif. —
As lightning lacerated the darkening sky over Mt. Whitney and thunderclaps started a deafening roll, the 13 hikers saw the old stone hut with its corrugated metal roof as a welcome refuge from the drenching downpour.
<br>
<br>
It nearly became their tomb.
<br><br>
“I was sitting on the floor, my back against one of the walls,” said Edward (E.J.) Wueherer, a hiker from Tehachapi. “All of a sudden I saw this flash and I felt this jolt like on my funny bone, and my toe started burning.
<br><br>
“The next thing I knew I was helping to untangle bodies.”
<br><br>
The surging electrical charge threw Matthew Edward Nordbrock, who had been seated in the center of the hut, several feet, where he lay still on the ground.
<br><br>
As the hikers had sprinted for cover during the squall Saturday afternoon, Nordbrock, 26, of Huntington Beach, told one of his hiking buddies: “I’ve been hit by lightning before, so I won’t get struck.”
<br><br>
He died several hours later, after being removed from the 14,495-foot summit by helicopter.

#### Day 3: Summit Day

We went to bed around 8:00 p.m. that night and set our alarms for 2 a.m., but too excited to start the climb, we all naturally woke up at 1:00 a.m. We arrived at the Mount Whitney trailhead around 2:00 a.m.

Until about 5 a.m., we navigated the mountain trail by relying completely on our trusty headlamps.

title="" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> *Mile 2: Stream crossing* </center>

There were a couple of streams that we had to cross, but they were quite manageable and my feet never got soaked. We scheduled periodic snack breaks every 1.5 hours and took breaks and filtered water as needed.

<center> *5:42 a.m. – Mile 4: Sunrise* </center>

After around three hours of hiking in complete darkness, we could begin to see faint glow of the rising sun. There were few people on the trail and it was incredibly serene.

<img src="/whitney/whitney.jpg" alt=""

We saw a lot more people as we neared the trail camp. Unlike us knuckleheads, most sane people take on this mountain in multiple days. We watched groups of of backpackers fold up their tents as they readied themselves to tackle the summit.

title="" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> *5:58 a.m. – Mile 5: Trail Camp (12,039 ft, 3,669 m)* </center>

This was the last place to get water according to both online and local sources. According to an online source, we only needed 1.5L to 2L of water, which we realized didn't make sense only after it was too late.

2 liters of water got me to trail camp and the route to trail camp was only a quarter of the entire trail. From trail camp to summit and back to trail camp was around half of the entire trail, so at the very least we should have brought 4L of water.

This also marked the beginning of the infamous "97-switchbacks".

As we neared the summit, Doug ran out of water. Hiking without water at such an altitude was a recipe for disaster. Since we carried water filters with us, I suggested that the next person who had to piss should piss into one of our water filter instead.

Newton was the next to piss so he pissed into the filter. Doug refused to drink water that had been filtered from piss, so Newton offered the remaining of his water to Doug and decided to drink the filtered piss himself. According to Netwon, the filtered urine was slightly bitter but otherwise tasted fine.

<center> *9:37 a.m. – Mile 9: Looking east at the summit from the Trail Crest* </center>

It was around this point that acute mountain sickness began to seriously impact our performance. Even with the two previous days of acclimatization, Nori's heartrate remained a steady 180 BPM while running out of breath consistently, Newton felt nauseous and wanted to puke, and we all had the worst headaches of our entire lives. Every time we moved, we could feel our heads throbbing and pulsating with blood. We traveled at what we called, "my grandpa's walking speed".

<center> *10:22 a.m. – Mile 10: The snowfield before the summit* </center>

There was no way that we would come this far to turn back now. Giving up was not an option. Confronting the altitude sickness, harsh winds, and the near-zero temperatures, we trudged onwards and eventually made it to the summit.

<center> *11:09 a.m. – Mile 11: Mount Whitney summit (14,505 ft / 4,421 m)* </center>

At last, we made it! To celebrate, Doug and I had some refreshing Tangerine Express IPA. In hindsight, consuming alcohol at the summit might not have been the smartest idea as it slows down acclimatization and dehydrates you, but YOLO. We hung out for some lunch, drinks, and pictures before quickly descending to ease the symptoms of altitude sickness. Thankfully, we found a few sources of water that we could filter on the way down that prevented us from dangerous dehydration.

The summit was only halfway. Descending wasn't easy, until some hikers told us about the best burger ever at the Whitney Portal Store. Picturing fat juicy burgers in our heads, we immedaitely began running down the mountain to make it to the store before it closed. Doug injured his knee on the descent so Netwon stayed with him while Nori an I ran down the remaining 5 miles of the mountain trail to order burgers for all of us. We made it down in record time. What better motivation than food?

<center> *6:00 p.m. – Mile 22: The best burger ever* </center>

In total, the hike took just under 16 hours. What a day.

#### Overall, was it worth it?

Definitely.

This hike may be the hardest non-technical day-hike in the contiguous US. At the very least, it's the tallest. The hike wasn't technical at all. I remember only having to use my hands twice, when there were icy rocks on the switchbacks and when I slipped coming down on the snowfield.

Though it was a long hike, anyone who is somewhat athletic and has good cardiovascular health should be able to conquer this mountain. Training will vary from person to person. A few months before this, I trained for a marathon at a 3:30 to 4:00 pace and I did a 10+ mile trek in Washington state. I also did some targeted work on my calves, side glutes, and hip flexors because of some muscle imbalances. Besides having also trained for and ran a marathon a few months prior, Doug didn't do any extra training for the hike and was also fine. None of us felt anything besides some slight soreness the next day.

The hardest part of the hike was the symptoms of altitude sickness. Only Advil made the altitude sickness bearable.

#### What's next?

There are two routes I can take. I can either stick with non-technical hikes and start doing multi-day hikes, or I can start doing technical hikes.

More challenging non-technical hikes include [Mount Kilimanjaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro) (19,341 ft / 5,895 m) in Tanzania, Africa or [Mount Aconcagua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aconcagua) (22,837 ft / 6,960 m) in Argentina, South America. Both of these are part of the [Seven Summits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Summits), which are now on my radar.

Or, I could start learning technical mountaineering skills such as self-arrest with an ice axe and begin to do technical climbs such as on [Mount Rainier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier) (14,111 ft / 4,392 m).

Whatever I choose, this hike has done a poor job at deterring me from more challenging hikes and only has me craving more.

#### My Complete Packing List&#42;

Besides the beer, I suggest that you bring all the following and only the following. Anything not listed is non-essential and should be avoided to reduce weight. This packing list is only for the day-hikers. Multi-day summits will require extra gear such as a tent, sleeping bag, etc.

&#42;My recommendations are in parentheses. <br>
&#42;&#42;The amount of water you bring depends on the mountain water conditions and the time of year. Check with the park ranger or with recent hikers through [AllTrails](https://www.facebook.com/groups/30962451768/about/) or the [Mt. Whitney Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/30962451768/about/) to see how much water you should be bringing. <br>

&#42;&#42;&#42; Bring and drink at your own risk. <br>
&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;You will be given one of these for each person in your group when you pick up your permit.

If you have any questions or need any tips regarding the hike, feel free to reach out!

Lastly, do your research and take everything with a grain of salt. Experiences are all very subjective. If you want to summit Mount Whitney, start preparing before Feb of that year since the permit lottery happens during that time. The hardest part may actually be getting a permit since the admission rate is about 30%. Overnight permits are sought after even more.
See [Mount Whitney via Mount Whitney Trail on AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mount-whitney-via-mount-whitney-trail) for more information about the trail.
