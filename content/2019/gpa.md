> If you don't believe in yourself, nobody else will. â€“ Me

During my junior year of high school, when everybody else was trying the hardest that they have ever tried, I was on the verge of being put on academic probation. I ended my first semester of junior year with a 1.96 / 4.00 GPA. For those that aren't familiar with the GPA scale, 1.96 is equivalent to a C+ (77%-79%).

*I wasn't kidding.*

I applied to college with a 2.92 GPA.

To put that into perspective, the average GPA for University of Michigan's accepted class in 2018 was 3.88 / 4.00.

Oh and fun fact, I also got a 1 (failing score) on the AP comuter science exam.

This post will be split into two sections. Section one will be about why my GPA was so terrible. Section two what I learned from this experience.

### Why Was My GPA So Bad?

If you look at this graph maybe it'll make sense to you.

I was first introduced to League of Legends around the end of my freshman year. I was well-known in my school as beinge the worst League of Legends players in my grade.It was a popular game amongst at my school and I was made fun of constantly for how bad I was at the game. Like the class-clown, it was somewhat fun getting attentio this way, but deep down,

It was around that point when I decided that I would stop at nothing to become one of the best players out there.

I was stuck at the bottom 10% of the players for the longest time. I was in what they called "Elo hell" (Elo is the name of player ranking system. similar to how chess players are ranked.)

I had many serious fights wwith my parents during my sophoomer year due to my falling grades and me constantly skipping classes and sleeping through exams.

By the start of my sophomore year, my parents I caused my parents to give up on me.

Then slowly, as I spent more and more time on improving my game mechanics, I slowly became better and ended up in the top 1% of players around the end of my junior year.

Alas, I finally became better than all my peers at League of Legends. It wasn't easy. I stayed up til 4 AM on weekdays even when I had swim practice before school at 6 AM. I practiced my mechanics continuously for 10s of hours on the weekends and played an estimated total of more than 1500 hours on the game.

The reason why my GPA was so bad in high school is simple. I spent all of my time trying to become better than my peers at League of Legends. (And I did it.)

### Dream Big and Never Stop Believing in Yourself

Like my dream of becoming the top 1% of players in League of Legends, I kept dreaming, kept setting goals for myself, and kept achieving them.

I've always had big dreams. I think everybody should. I dislike people who laugh at others for having big dreams. It's the one trait that I value more than everything else. Dreams that are big enough motivate people and motivated people change the world.

I remember that my biggest goal as a kid was to become a billionaire. I don't know why, it just seemed like a goal that was challenging.

That was slightly far-fetched for me at the time so I broke that goal down. When I was luckily accepted by UMass Amherst, the only thing I had on my mind was to transfer to a better university such as Columbia or UMich. The statistics told me that going to one of these schools gave me the highest probability of becoming a billionaire.

From my junior year to accepting my admission to UMich in April 2017, everything I did was to transfer.

After that, my goal was to get an internship at a Big 4, which I achieved in September 2018.

My next goal will be to find my dream job, wherever that is.

One day, I will start my own billion dollar company.

Note: It's also okay if your goals change. Unexpected things will happen and there's nothing wrong with changing your goals, as long as you don't change them too often. To know when a goal is worth changing, I reflect and honestly ask myself the following question, "is this goal taking me in the direction that truly makes me happy or am I just doing something that others want me to do?"

For example, between my sophomore and senior year, the only thing that I wanted to do was to do research in machine learning, get a Ph.D. in machine learning at a school like Stanford, and work at Google DeepMind. I went soul-searching for quite a while, but realized that I was only doing it because it was the hottest thing in computer science and not because I truly enjoyed the field. What I really enjoyed was building communities and products. See [Being President Was The Best Thing I Did In College](/2019/president/)

### Conclusion

I hope your takeaway from this post isn't that I was stupid or that my parents are failures or that I like bragging about my accomplishments/goals. (I find that it's hard to sometimes convey the same message to everybody.)

So I'll just flat out tell you that the objective of my post is to convince you to dream big and never stop believing in yourself. As long as you dream big and you believe in yourself, you will do what is neccesary to accomplish your dreams. Though this following quote is not quite scientifically accurate, you know what they say:
