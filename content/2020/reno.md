I'm moving to Reno, Nevada. Why?

Lake Tahoe, Nevada
(Besides being within a 1-hour drive to this beautiful lake that is.)

Before I even settled on moving to Reno, Nevada, two reasons made me want to move from Ann Arbor, Michigan. First, as I started working for Virtually, Inc. remotely, I realized that If I could work anywhere, why not choose where to live instead of staying in Ann Arbor? Plus, Carol, my girlfriend was willing to relocate with me as all of her classes would be remote for next semester and potentially the one after that as well.
Second, seeing that the COVID situation grew worse and worse, I began to think about moving to the middle of nowhere, where the chance of catching the virus would be lower. where at the time, people didn't seem to care about COVID, and there were unpleasant political events.

I thought about Hawaii, New Zealand, the middle of nowhere US, etc.
But out of all of the places in the world, why Reno?

Primary considerations:
My first consideration or most important factor to consider was the proximity to family and friends. Having used to live near San Jose, California, my parents really enjoyed the weather, so they wanted to move back to California after retirement next year. Many of my childhood, high school, and college friends live in Seattle or the Bay Area.

Therefore, I decided that I wanted to be near Seattle or the Bay area.

The next important consideration for me was how I'mI could align with some of my life goals. At some point, I'd love to climb all seven summits. (The tallest mountain on each continent.). To get in shape for mountain climbing, there's not a better training ground than real mountains. Besides Alaska and Colorada, the next best place would be the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California (it turns out, that this mountain range was even closer to Reno than any other major city in California)

Seattle wouldn't be too bad either, but Rainier is the only 14er, very snowy, technical, and I would get bored of climbing the same mountain repeatedly.

So, it seemed like I narrowed my choices to the Bay Area.

The next factor would be the deciding factor for me. Given that working at an early stage startup means low starting salary but potential for massive growth in stock value, I wanted to live somewhere with a lower cost of living. Since I could move anywhere, why would I live in the Bay area where a 1Br costs \$2500-3000? Plus, state taxes in Ca go up to 13%, depending on your income.

Now, which state near California has no state income tax? NEVADA!

As I was looking at places to live near the Bay area, I stumbled upon Reno, Reno, being near Lake Tahoe, is actually quite a desirable place for many people and many reasons. Here are just a few stats about the area:

Supporting
Reasons:
Teslas first and largest gigafactory

Top producer of metals such as gold in the USA

A lot of land?
Cheaper than bay area, yet still reasonably close to it
An exponentially increasing rate of pop growth
Increase housing prices

Incline Village is super desirable and is already filled with billionaires and millionaires
Great place for businesses

"Bezos, who grew up in Houston, moved to Seattle to launch his startup in part because of Washington state's favorable tax structure."
Great place for outdoor activities such as skiing more often, etc.
Close enough to Bay Area for local sources of talent
Decent weather, not SF, but better than Michigan
Carol and I both like 4 season places

The more I researched the Reno area, the more I realized how perfect it would be.

As I talked to friends and family about this decision, they reaffirmed my decision unknowingly. 1. The professor I befriended while taking SI 360, Walt Borland, is from Incline Village, Nevada, which can be considered a part of the Reno area. He loved it there.

2. The person that I purchased my 2006 Honda Pilot EX from lived in Reno for a few years. He loved it there.
3. A few friends of mine, at least Edward, and Douglas have been to Reno on the way to Lake Tahoe.
4. After talking to my parents, they told me that they used to go to Reno all the time when they went skiing in Lake Tahoe. 5. My friend Joe living in Seattle, has heard about lake Tahoe and is planning on visiting.
5. My sister Jeni, who lives in LA, was also planning on doing a camping trip at Lake Tahoe.

So, it turns out that the Reno area was way more popular than I had imagined. I could get Lake Tahoe's benefits, enjoy the cheap cost of living, and see my friends occasionally.

7. I even called a previous tenant what the place I'm living and they said they said loved it if you like the outdoors.

So, in summary, I picked Nevada for the
Within 3-hour driving distance to friends and family
Near 14er mountains for climbing in all seasons
Low/no income tax
Cheap housing \$700/month

Bonus, close to the beach
Have mutual connections in politics and entrepreneurship there

Some bonuses, why not SF:
Sf has earthquakes, insert statistic 99% chance of magnitude 7.0 earthquake hitting SF in the next 40 years. SF is going to go under potentially due to global warming. Cities suck because you share stuff with people due to COVID, makes it challenging to have a dog, loud, dirty,

70% chance o
Within the next 30 years, the probability is:
72% that an earthquake measuring magnitude 6.7
51% that an earthquake measuring magnitude 7

Other parts of the Bay could be better, but again earthquakes and global warming.

So yeah, that's why I'm moving to Reno, Nevada.

Disclaimer: Of course, moving to Reno may not apply to everyone. Obviously, I haven't moved there yet, so I can't vouch for it with first-hand experiences.
