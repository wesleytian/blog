Many of my friends have been wondering what I have been doing with my time now that I finished my undergraduate studies, have no job and am still waiting to hear back from graduate school in mid-March. If you end up like me, without a job and in a state of limbo, perhaps this post can help give you some ideas on how to schedule your time.

Today is Feb. 5th, 2020. It's been nearly one-and-a-half months (6.5 weeks) since I finished my last college exam at 9:00 PM on Dec. 17th, 2019. I officially graduated on Dec. 20th.

### Weeks 1-3

From Dec. 20th, 2019 to Jan 1st, 2020, I studied for my retake of the GRE general exam.  I took the GRE the next day on January 2nd. For the next week, from Jan. 3rd to Jan. 10th, I spent most of my time working on my Statement of Purpose for the only graduate program I'm applying to–Stanford's M.S. in Management Science & Engineering program–watching movies, reading books, working out, and playing the violin occasionally. After having played from age ten to eighteen, I wanted to pick the violin up again because one, I didn't want to lose my violin skills and two, playing an instrument has great mental benefits. To do so, I purchased an electric violin from Shar's Music shop in Ann Arbor. 

### Week 4

On January 10th, I traveled to Spain with my girlfriend, Carol Zhang. We stayed in Madrid for a week. Coincidentally, one of my professors from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who I became quite close with during my time there, happened to also be visiting Madrid so we hung out a couple of times. I am planning to write a trip report soon. I will be mainly discussing fundamental differences in culture and what can be learned from the European way of life. I will also be reviewing Madrid and Toledo, Spain as a tourist destination.

### Weeks 5-6

After coming back from Spain, I decided to finally take a completely unscheduled,  two-week break, after completing school and finishing my graduate school application. I watched the following films and read the following books. 

- Shutter Island (2010), Martin Scorsese
- Ad Astra (2019), James Gray
- Shazam! (2019), David Sandberg
- The Mandalorian, Season 1 (2019), Jon Favreau
- Star Trek (2009), J.J. Abrams
- Minority Report (2002), Steven Spielberg
- A Clockwork Orange (1971), Stanley Kubrick
- The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), Peter Jackson
- The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Peter Jackson
- The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Peter Jackson
- Interstellar (2014), Christopher Nolan
- Your Name. (2016), Makoto Shinkai

- Originals by Adam Grant
- Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil
- How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan
- The Science of Interstellar by Kip Thorne
- and made some decent progress on The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand

I would highly highly highly recommend Interstellar. At one point during the film, I cried uncontrollably. I also highly recommend the Mandalorian, mainly because of baby Yoda. It's 100% worth watching just because of baby Yoda. A Clockwork Orange is a great classic with deep connotations that I think everybody should also read/watch at some point in their lives. I also found Weapons of Math Destruction and How to Change Your Mind to be quite enlightening.

Additionally, I sold some of my unused belongings on eBay and worked through my finances. As per a friend's suggestion, I tried to get [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/), a double-entry bookkeeping computer language and [Fava](https://beancount.github.io/fava/), a web interface for Beancount to work, but I couldn't get [ofxclient](https://captin411.github.io/ofxclient/), a way to download financial statements automatically, to work due to an authentication error.  Had it worked, it might've been quite effective. As per another friend's suggestion, I ended up just using a Google spreadsheet. This has been the most effective method of keeping track of my spending habits so far, even better than what I previously used, [Intuit Inc.'s Mint](mint.com).

### Week 7+

After resting for two weeks, I've decided to make a schedule for myself and working on some areas of my choice. I find that setting an alarm for early in the morning, making your bed, getting dressed into clothes that aren't sweatpants and sweatshirts, and not getting on my phone until after a few hours of work has been substantially helpful to helping me stay productive.

This is what a typical day looks like for me now. I'm still trying to move my sleep schedule back so that I wake up around 6–7 AM so that it matches my girlfriend's since she stays over occasionally. I find that waking up early also helps me be more productive.

I will watch a movie with dinner, and spend my time doing whatever I want afterward, until a few hours before bed when I put away all of my electronics and start reading. 

I've also started looking for ways to make some money by looking for temporary paid jobs and researching business ideas. In addition, I'm currently talking to members of the [Borjigin Lab in the U-M Medical School, Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology](https://borjigin.lab.medicine.umich.edu/home) regarding a project on the role of an endogenous hallucinogen called N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

Looking forward, I hope to successfully start a business to net some income, as well as doing interview prep and applying to long-term jobs.

### FAQ

Q: How have you been supporting yourself?

A: I have some saved up cash from my previous internship at Microsoft. After netting good returns by investing my own money, I was able to convince my parents to loan me some money to invest. I was able to negotiate to keep $0.50 for every dollar I make. This is not that much income, but I am still very grateful to be given this opportunity. I am also running quite low on funds which is why I have decided to apply to short-term jobs.

Q: Have you gotten lonely?

A: I don't think anybody has actually asked me this, but yeah it has gotten kind of lonely. I only started to feel lonely after all of my housemates went home for winter break and I was the only person in our house for nearly 20 days, from Dec. 20th to Jan. 8th. I spent New Year's and Christmas day alone, taking GRE practice exams. However, to whom I am very grateful, a good friend of mine from high school was back in Troy, Michigan for winter break and his family invited me over to his house for dinner on Christmas Eve. That was the extent of my social life over the break. The main reason why I stayed in Ann Arbor was that I was studying for the GRE and working on my Statement of Purpose. Had I not had to do this, perhaps I would have visited my parents in China.
