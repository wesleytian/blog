Many of my friends have been wondering what I have been doing with my time now that I finished my undergraduate studies, have no job and am still waiting to hear back from graduate school in mid-March. 

I'm writing this post because 

### December, Weeks 2-3

I graduated on December 20th, 2019. Afterward, I studied for the GRE general exam.  I took the GRE the next day on January 2nd.

###January, Week 1

 For the next week, from Jan. 3rd to Jan. 10th, I spent most of my time working on my Statement of Purpose for the only graduate program I'm applying to–Stanford's M.S. in Management Science & Engineering program–watching movies, reading books, working out, and playing the violin occasionally. After having played from age ten to eighteen, I wanted to pick the violin up again because one, I didn't want to lose my violin skills and two, playing an instrument has great mental benefits. To do so, I purchased an electric violin from Shar's Music shop in Ann Arbor. 

### January, Week 2

On January 10th, I traveled to Spain with my girlfriend, Carol Zhang. We stayed in Madrid for a week. Coincidentally, one of my professors from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who I became quite close with during my time there, happened to also be visiting Madrid so we hung out a couple of times. I am planning to write a trip report soon. I will be mainly discussing fundamental differences in culture and what can be learned from the European way of life. I will also be reviewing Madrid and Toledo, Spain as a tourist destination.

### January, Weeks 3-4

After coming back from Spain, I decided to finally take a completely unscheduled,  two-week break, after completing school and finishing my graduate school application.

I would highly highly highly recommend Interstellar. At one point during the film, I cried uncontrollably. I also highly recommend the Mandalorian, mainly because of baby Yoda. It's 100% worth watching just because of baby Yoda. A Clockwork Orange is a great classic with deep connotations that I think everybody should also read/watch at some point in their lives. I also found Weapons of Math Destruction and How to Change Your Mind to be quite enlightening.

Additionally, I sold some of my unused belongings on eBay and worked through my finances. As per a friend's suggestion, I tried to get [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/), a double-entry bookkeeping computer language and [Fava](https://beancount.github.io/fava/), a web interface for Beancount to work, but I couldn't get [ofxclient](https://captin411.github.io/ofxclient/), a way to download financial statements automatically, to work due to an authentication error.  Had it worked, it might've been quite effective. As per another friend's suggestion, I ended up just using a Google spreadsheet. This has been the most effective method of keeping track of my spending habits so far, even better than what I previously used, [Intuit Inc.'s Mint](mint.com).

### February, Week 1

After resting for two weeks, I've decided to make a schedule for myself and working on some areas of my choice. I find that setting an alarm for early in the morning, making your bed, getting dressed into clothes that aren't sweatpants and sweatshirts, and not getting on my phone until after a few hours of work has been substantially helpful to helping me stay productive.

This is what a typical day looks like for me now. I'm still trying to move my sleep schedule back so that I wake up around 6–7 AM so that it matches my girlfriend's since she stays over occasionally. I find that waking up early also helps me be more productive.

I will watch a movie with dinner, and spend my time doing whatever I want afterward, until a few hours before bed when I put away all of my electronics and start reading. 

I've also started looking for ways to make some money by looking for temporary paid jobs and researching business ideas. In addition, I'm currently talking to members of the [Borjigin Lab in the U-M Medical School, Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology](https://borjigin.lab.medicine.umich.edu/home) regarding a project on the role of an endogenous hallucinogen called N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).

Looking forward, I hope to successfully start a business to net some income, as well as doing interview prep and applying to long-term jobs.

### February, Weeks 2-4

I spent these three weeks working around 15-20 hours a week in Dr. Borjigin's Lab in the U-M Medical School, Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology. I also spent some time looking for paid positions in research labs, with Ding Tea, and at the dining hall, but had no leads. (Pro Tip: If you want free groceries, take a look at the Maize & Blue Cupboard. They have free groceries as long as you are a student.)

###March, Weeks 1-2

I heard back from Stanford and was rejected. Since then, I've applied to a couple of full-stack positions and have also been working on a web app that I intend to turn into a profitable business. So far, it's been very enjoyable and I have been learning a lot such as how to handle scammers, which database to use, React, and payments APIs.  I will and have applied to and interviewed with talent investors and incubators to allow me to continue working on this app. I've also been reaching out to people to help me work on this. Regardless of what the outcome of this app is, I think that this would be an amazing learning experience for me. In addition, I've realized that I really enjoy full-stack development. I enjoy working on the front-end and connecting the front-end to the back-end through APIs and requests.
