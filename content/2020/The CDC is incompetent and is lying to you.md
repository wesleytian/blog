The CDC is incompetent and is lying to you.

It has recently come to my attention that many people are choosing not to wear masks. Not only is doing this a risk to yourself but also a risk to other people, especially ones who you don't know. This is a reasonable train of thought given the increasing number of articles about how it's a terrible idea to wear masks:

None of these articles cite any reliable sources except for the CDC, which I will expose as unreliable in a moment. If it really wasn't effective for either the spread of disease

1.

1) Are "facemasks" effective for the prevention of the COVID-19.
2) Are "facemasks" effective for the spread of the COVID-19.
3) Are "masks", including N95 masks effective for the prevention or spread of COVID-19.
4) Are N99 masks

Obviously articles with information that are based on a factually false premise should be disregarded. https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s0226-Covid-19-spread.html The CDC reported this (2/26/2020)

It angers me to no end to find that the CDC is not only incompetent in testing patients for the disease, even with months of time to prepare, they are also lying to the public and spreading information that is encouraging the proliferation of the COVID-19 virus.

Please spread this post or do your own research and spread your own findings. Do not listen to the authorities just because of who they are.

False. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirator-use-faq.html

N95 masks have been used in countries with high levels of PM2.5 pollution for decades. I've personally used these masks while living in Shanghai on days where the pollution is incredilby high. ![Screen Shot 2020-03-04 at 1.20.56 PM](/Users/wesleytian/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/Screen Shot 2020-03-04 at 1.20.56 PM.png)
