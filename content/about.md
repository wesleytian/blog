Wesley Tian is currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Data Science at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). He previously served as the President of the [Michigan Data Science Team](https://www.mdst.club/), a competitive data science team funded by Google, the National Science Foundation, and the [Michigan Institute of Data Science](https://midas.umich.edu/). Media outlets such as the [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/flint-water-lead-pipes.html?_r=0) and others have covered MDST's work for social good.

In the past few years, Wesley has worked on research and development at an Internet of things startup with [Rui Wang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ruiwang/)&#42;, machine learning research in healthcare with [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/), and philosophy in artificial intelligence with [Rich Thomason](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rthomaso/)&#42;&#42;. Last summer, he was hired by conversational AI startup, [Clinc](https://clinc.com/), to improve their machine learning models. This past summer, he developed internal tools under Microsoft's Cloud + AI Platform.

He was born in Mountain View, California, and then moved to Oregon, Taiwan, back to Oregon, Shanghai, Massachusetts, and finally, Michigan. He spent the first two years of his undergrad in Amherst, MA, first studying Environmental Science, then Computer Science and Mathematics. He thanks these moves for his openness to different perspectives and helping form many of his unique thoughts. Outside of school and work, he enjoys reading, writing, and hiking. His favorite hikes include Greece's [Mount Olympus](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/greece/crete--3/mount-olympus-from-prionia-trailhead?u=i), the [Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/cascade-pass-and-sahale-arm-trail--2) in Washington's North Cascades National Park, and [Mount Whitney](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mount-whitney-via-mount-whitney-trail), the tallest mountain in the contiguous US.
