Wesley Tian is currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Data Science at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). He recently served as the President of the [Michigan Data Science Team](https://www.mdst.club/), a competitive data science team funded by Google, the National Science Foundation, and the [Michigan Institute of Data Science](https://midas.umich.edu/). Media outlets such as the [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/flint-water-lead-pipes.html?_r=0) and others have covered their work for social good.

In the past few years, Wesley has worked on research and development at an Internet of things startup with [Rui Wang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ruiwang/), machine learning research in healthcare with [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/), and philosophy in artificial intelligence with [Rich Thomason](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rthomaso/). Last summer, he was hired by conversational AI startup, [Clinc](https://clinc.com/), to improve their machine learning models. This summer, he will be working on Microsoft's Cloud + AI Platform.

Wesley ranked 1st out of 205 students on a deep learning prediction challenge in University of Michigan's Machine Learning course, placed 3rd in the world in MIT's [ASSISTments Data Mining Competition](https://sites.google.com/view/assistmentsdatamining/data-mining-competition-2017/winners?authuser=0), and received awards at many other hackathons. He has also been a recipient of the Chancellor's Scholarship.

Born non-uniquely in Mountain View, California, but uniquely relocated to Oregon, Taiwan, Shanghai, Massachusetts, and finally Michigan. He spent the first two years of his undergrad in Amherst, MA, first studying Environmental Science, then Computer Science and Mathematics. He thanks these moves for his openness to different perspectives and helping form many of his unique thoughts. Outside of school and work, he enjoys reading, writing, and running.

Wesley has been a utilitarian and determinist since his teens. He once pursued a doctorate in machine learning research until he realized he would be wasting some of his other strengths. His current pursuits are software engineering, political philosophy, and entrepreneurship.
