Hi! 

Welcome to my website.

I made this blog primarily because I enjoy writing and want to get better at it. I also want to share what I've learned from my real-life experiences with other people, just as others have shared with me (e.g. [Phillip Guo](www.pgbovine.net), [Sam Altman](blog.samaltman.com), and [Paul Graham](paulgraham.com)). This blog is intended cover a smorgasbord of topics â€“ from hardware projects to philosophy. If you'd like to discuss any post in detail, please leave a comment in the respective post's comment section.

Tags for posts include #work, #personal, #school, #internship, #project, #programming, #advice, and #travel. If you'd like to view posts with a certain tag, please navigate to wesleytian.com/tags/name_of_tag (e.g. [wesleytian.com/tags/personal](/tags/personal)).
