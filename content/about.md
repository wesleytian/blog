Wesley has few official titles, but those don't really describe what kind of person he is. Deep down,  he just wants to be happy and free. But just like  everybody else these days, he's fallen under society's spell to walk the common road of a quality education and a well-paying job.

Wesley's goal is to eventually break free from that spell and gain the confidence to completely disregard both his own and other people's judgments. At the same time, he'd like to be doing something that he loves and benefits mankind.

These are a few philosophies that Wesley lives by:

1. He believes it is mankind's ultimate goal to explore and conquer the universe(s). He plans on helping mankind achieve that goal by ultimately expending his resources on improving spacefaring technologies.

2. As far as we know, we only have one life. So, why not try and enjoy all that life has to offer while we still can?

3. Never be afraid to be different and to speak your mind. It's people who are different that do great things. It is more valuable to know you're wrong than to not know anything.
