He currently serves as the President of the [Michigan Data Science Team](https://www.mdst.club/), a competitive data science team funded by Google, the National Science Foundation, and the [Michigan Institute of Data Science](https://midas.umich.edu/). Their work for social good has been covered by media outlets such as the [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/flint-water-lead-pipes.html?_r=0), [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-flint-prioritize-which-lead-pipes-nee-1774517926), and the [Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/midwest/ct-flint-water-app-20161211-story.html). 

In the past, Wesley has worked on research and development at an Internet of things startup with [Rui Wang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ruiwang/), machine learning research in healthcare with [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/), and philosophy in artificial intelligence with [Rich Thomason](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rthomaso/).

Originally from Mountain View, California, Wesley has transferred schools a total of eight times, relocating from California to Oregon, Taiwan, Shanghai, Massachusetts, and Michigan in the process. He thanks these moves to his openness to new perspectives and helping form many of his own unique thoughts. Outside of school and work, he enjoys reading, writing, and running.

Wesley is also a utilitarian, Buddhist, biocentrist, and evolutionary humanist. His current interests are software engineering and political philosophy. His greatest influencers are Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Yuval Noah Harari.
