Hi, there.

Welcome to my personal blog!

I created this website because I enjoy writing and want to get better at it. I also want to share what I've learned from my life experiences with other people, just as others have shared with me (e.g. [Phillip Guo](www.pgbovine.net), [Sam Altman](blog.samaltman.com), and [Paul Graham](paulgraham.com)). This blog is intended cover a smorgasbord of topics â€“ from hardware projects to philosophical musings. I'd love it if you left some comments on my posts.

## About Me

I recently recieved my Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Michigan. While there, I studied computer science, data science, and entrepreneurship. I also served as the president of the [Michigan Data Science Team](https://news.engin.umich.edu/2018/08/michigan-data-science-team-wrangles-big-data/).

Before attending the University of Michigan, I took classes in computer science, mathematics, and economics in Amherst, Massachusetts.

I have interned as a software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, [Clinc AI](https://clinc.com/) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Fidelity Investments in Merrimack, New Hampshire.

Although I was born in Mountain View, California and lived in Milpitas, California for the first 5.5 years of my life, I have also lived in West Linn, Oregon (2.5 years), Taipei, Taiwan (1.5 years), Shanghai, China (2.5 years in the Lujiazui Subdistrict and 6 years in the Huamu Subdistrict), Amherst, Massachusetts (2 years), and Ann Arbor, Michigan (2.5 years).

My hobbies are writing, reading, mountain climbing, running, powerlifting, playing the violin, trading, and getting better at Chinese.

Both my parents are naturalized Americans citizens of Chinese descent. My dad, Jason, was previously the VP of [Nikon Precisions China](https://www.nikon.com/products/semi/) and is currently the COO of [Piotech](http://en.sypiotech.cn/), a late-stage nano-scale semiconductor equipment startup in Shenyang, China. He is an alum of Northeastern University and Nanyang Technological University. My mom, Robin, is a graduate of the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and is currently retired. My older half-sister, Jeni, who grew up in Boston, Massachussetts, is the COO of [Legacy Brands International](https://lacannabisnews.com/chuuuch-cannabis-product-line-with-bishop-don-magic-juan-announced-as-the-latest-addition-to-legacy-brands-internationals-portfolio/) and was previously a co-founder and the Chief Marketing Officer of [Frilly](https://ktla.com/2017/11/29/customize-your-fashion-with-frilly-com/). She is currently attending culinary school in Paris, France.
