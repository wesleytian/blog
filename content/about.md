Hi! 

Welcome to my website.

I created this blog because I enjoy writing and want to get better at it. I also want to share what I've learned from my real-life experiences with other people, just as others have shared with me (e.g. [Phillip Guo](www.pgbovine.net), [Sam Altman](blog.samaltman.com), and [Paul Graham](paulgraham.com)). This blog is intended cover a smorgasbord of topics â€“ from hardware projects to philosophy. If you'd like to discuss any post in detail, please leave a comment in the respective post's comment section.

## About Me

I recently recieved my Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Michigan. While there, I studied computer science, data science and entrepreneurship. I also served as the president of the [Michigan Data Science Team](https://news.engin.umich.edu/2018/08/michigan-data-science-team-wrangles-big-data/).

Before attending the University of Michigan, I took classes in computer science, mathematics, and economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Although I was born in Mountain View, California and lived there for the first 5 years of my life, I have also lived Oregon (2.5 years), Taiwan (1.5 years), Shanghai (8 years), Massachusetts (2 years), and Michigan (2.5 years).
