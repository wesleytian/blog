Wesley Tian is currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Data Science at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). He currently serves as the President of the [Michigan Data Science Team](https://www.mdst.club/), a competitive data science team funded by Google, the National Science Foundation, and the [Michigan Institute of Data Science](https://midas.umich.edu/). Their work for social good has been covered by media outlets such as the [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/flint-water-lead-pipes.html?_r=0), [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-flint-prioritize-which-lead-pipes-nee-1774517926), and the [Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/midwest/ct-flint-water-app-20161211-story.html). You can read more about Wesley's goals for MDST in this [interview](http://eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2018/mdst-2018.html) by the University of Michigan's Computer Science Engineering department.

In the past, Wesley has worked on research and development at an Internet of things startup with [Rui Wang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ruiwang/), machine learning research in healthcare with [Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/), and philosophy in artificial intelligence with [Rich Thomason](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rthomaso/). Starting in high school, Wesley has also had numerous internships with companies such as [Xuanliang](http://www.dshine.com.cn/), [RaysHobby](https://rayshobby.net/wordpress/), Fidelity Investments, [Clinc](https://clinc.com/), and Microsoft.

Wesley has been ranked 1st out of 205 students on a deep learning prediction challenge in University of Michigan's Machine Learning course, placed 3rd in the world in MIT's [ASSISTments Data Mining Competition](https://sites.google.com/view/assistmentsdatamining/data-mining-competition-2017/winners?authuser=0), and received awards at multiple other hackathons. He has also been a recipient of the Chancellor's Scholarship.

Born in Mountain View, California–yes, before Google was there–Wesley has transferred schools a total of nine times. In the process, he has relocated from California to Oregon, Taiwan, Shanghai, Massachusetts, and finally Michigan. He thanks these moves for his openness to different perspectives and helping form many of his own unique thoughts. Outside of school and work, he enjoys reading, writing, and running.

Wesley is also a utilitarian, Buddhist, biocentrist, and evolutionary humanist. His past pursuits include machine learning and entrepreneurship. His current pursuits are software engineering and political philosophy. Some of his influencers are Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Yuval Noah Harari.
