#### Summary:

* Won most creative use of Indico API at Hamp Hack 2017.
* Awarded $2000/team member in API credits.
* Teammates: Nischal Tamang and Phillip Michalowski.

#### Why Did We Build This?
Usually, project ideas are either spawned from day-to-day life or assigned. However, since we decided to go to a hackathon without any preplanning, we had to come up with an idea on the spot. I think this usually works pretty well, because you don't actually know what the prizes are and that is what usually dictates what you are building. For example, there are company sponsored prizes for the "best" use of their API. 

The story of how we actually came up with this specific idea is very boring so I will spare you the details. The important part is that we saw that there was some object recognition API that could could be trained on different clothes and that there was a market need for filtering out mass amounts of clothing online to your specific style and preferences.

#### How Did We Build This?

#### What Did We Learn From Building This?
Perserverence is the most important factor. At around 7AM during the second day of the hackathon, Phillip and Nisch were discussing whether they wanted to head back to our dorms to take a nap. We hadn't slept for nearly 24 hours and were pretty exhausted. Given our prior experience with hackathons, I told them, "if we leave now, we're not going to come back." 

Phillip and Nisch ended up taking a power nap at our table and I took a power nap in their gym's sauna room. Later that night, we won a prize and that was an experience I would never forget.

#### Operating Instructions:

The web app doesn't actually work as intended. We didn't have enough time to get the back-end and front-end linked up, so we hardcoded some HTML pages to demonstrate the potential and concept.
