It's been a little over a month since I graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science degree. In this post, I'd like to reflect on some of my experiences from my collegiate years. If you've just matriculated to the University of Michigan, or any other college, perhaps you can learn a lesson or two from this post as well.

First, I'll talk about my favorite and least favorite classes at the University of Michigan. Next, I'll talk about some of my experiences in on-campus organizations and clubs. Finally, I'll discuss Ann Arbor as a whole.

My favorite classes at the University of Michigan were EECS 281: Data Structures and Algorithms and SI 360: Succeeding at Failing. Runner-ups include EECS 482: Operating Systems, EECS 445: Machine Learning, and PHIL 340: Mind and Machines.

While at the University of Michigan, I joined and participated in a myriad of clubs and organizations. I've been a part of the SHIFT Creator Space, the Michigan Data Science Team, the Michigan Student AI Lab, Blockchain @ Michigan, the Michigan Fintech Club, and the Triathlon Team.  
Find one or two clubs that you're interested in and try to make a positive impact on the community. Or, create your own community.
