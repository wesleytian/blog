Mental Illness

Right before finals week this past semester, I received three emails regarding mental illness. Two of them were targeted at EECS students while the third was addressed to the U of M student body as a whole.

-   SI 360 people being depressed

I've been fortunate to have never had to deal with any kind of mental illness in my life so far so I never realized how prevalant mental illness is until my closest friends in college began to experience depression, anxiety, and have breakdowns. Another one of my friends from high school passed away this past semester due to mental illness. Since we haven't been in contact for while, I'm still not sure to this day if his mental illness was related to school.

In this post, I want to talk about what I think can be done about mental illness on campus.

The biggest reason that I've seen for mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety on campus is caused by classes. A common recipe for depression is extreme student debty, fear of poor job prospects, family issues, etc. But my friends who had depression/anxiety had none of these. They luckly have 0 student debt, have had great internships at companies such as Microsoft, and have a bright future ahead. Both of these students were in fact straight A students with GPAs of over a 3.90 in EECS majors. Now why did these people still happen to be terribly unhappy during college?

Using these two people as case studies, I believe the culprit is due to external pressure to do something that might make them do something that isn't neccesarily the most comfortable for them. For one of them, the pressure came from his parent to pursue a study that he didn't necessarily enjoy. For the other, the pressure came from her mom to do well in school, but also from herself/others because she didn't want to be viewed as a lesser person because of not doing well in a class.

In fact, I can also relate to this as the times that I have been sad during college were because I was comparing myself to others and thinking that I'm inferior. This put pressure on me that I couldn't relieve because I had unrealistic comparisons. I remember comparing myself to this one girl who went to Stanford, and interned at Goldman Sachs as a Investment banker, Google as a software engineer, and McKinsey as a consultant during her undergrad, published papers, and more.

In all three of these examples, the pressure is due to a mix of internal feelings of inadequacy and external reasons.

Short-term solutions that have worked out very well to me is to maintain a good sleep routine/hygiene schedule and to workout regularly, especially if you are feeling down. There's bountifl research that suggest that working out releases "feel-good" horrmones in your body and the state of being in "flow" while exercising can temporarily block out negative thoughts because your brain has to focus on working out. In other words you are forcing yourself to block out the capacity to think negative thoughts by doing something that takes up 100% of your attention.

Perhaps a longer-term solution is to change how you think about things. There are tons of studies about how being happy is more about how you react to your life circumstances than your actual circumstances. Especially when your basic needs have already been satisfied. I may have been blessed with good genetics for emotional stability, but there are certain things that I do that also help with it.

Meditation is a big one. Studies here and here have shown that you can increase your ability to handle negative emotions by meditating every day. My personal suggestion is to start by sitting with your eyes closed for 5 minutes a day right after you wake-up. You have more activation energy in the morning so you are more likely to do it. The most important thing is to form a habit, and then increase the duration as desired. It's more beneficial to meditate for 5 minutes a day for a month straight then to meditate for 30 minutes the first day and then quit because it was too hard.

I'm sure you've all heard of these above. You can look them up yourself if you're interested. Just search "how to reduce stress". But more importantly, I think it has to do with a more fundamental psychological problem. As humans, we innately desire to be better than the people around us. This is a primal instinct to help us survive and increase the number of offspring we have as well as to increase the change of a community surviving. People who are rewarded for doing things for others feel good.

In college, there are few things to compare yourself to others with. Especially when you go to a academically rigorous school such a U of M and you spend almost all of your time working on class homework, studying for exams and working on projects, you tend to associate a lot of things with your grades and without knowing it, your self-worth becomes conflated with your grades. For many people, this isn't the case. But the majority of people in college, your grades are the things that stress you out the most. Projects, exams, and handing in assignments on time. Time management can help to some degree by helping you finish everything on time, but people still stress too much.

Stress is also a primal thing. It used to be very useful to humans such as by alerting us of predators, but when we become stressed over a letter or number that means nothing in the grand scheme of things and that seriously impacts our mental and as an extension or physical health, then there's a problem.

Not only is the metric of grades a terrible metric on its own, comparing yourself to other people by your grades is worse than comparing yourself to othe people based on how much money you make.

It's hard not to play the game. If you don't play it, then you lose out in career opportunities, and potentially other opportunities in life. You may be less happy overall. But, if you do play the game and your health suffers drastically, is it really worth it?

It's a hard problem, and I don't have a good solution to thinking about this besides the lifestyle changes I mentioned above, but I think it's something worth talking about.

As cliche as this advice is, I think the best approach is to learn for the sake of learning and understanding the material, and to do things for the sake of doing them and not because of some metric or to be better than the people around you. As Quinn Harr, my GSI for SI 360 (Succeding at Faliing) and Philosophy PhD said, Do things for the right reason. Don't go to Michigan because of the name, go there because it may offer classes that you're more interested in learning about. Don't try to get As because you want to be better than the people around you or because your parents want you to do well in school, get an A because you enjoy learning and mastering the material. And if you've tried to learn and master the material but don't get an A, that's totally okay. The grade should be irrelevant. If you enjoy learning and understanding the material, it should actually make it easier to do better in a class. However if your aim is to get some letter grade, then you may actually do worse because you will be focused on cramming for exams instead of understanding the material. Not only is it beneficial for you in the short-term but also for your learning in the long-term.

And don't do machine learning because everybody else is doing it or do CS because everybody else is doing it. Do them because the material is interesting to you or because it'll be a good path for you to make money and support your family. Do things for the right reasons.

If you've made it this far, perhaps you think that I have it all figured out or that I'm preteding to. Truth be told, these blog posts are advice for other people but they are all so reflections for myself and a way for me to materialize what I've learned and still need to work on. I may not have had mental illnesses during college or have better genes in some aspects, but I've faced and will continue to face the problems above. If everybody talks about this, perhaps one day people will be happier and rates of mental illness and depression will be lower.
